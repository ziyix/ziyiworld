<p>Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to interview me. My name is Ziyi Xu, a senior at USC studying Data Science & Economics with a minor in digital studies. One of the classes that I took at USC for my digital studies minor was called procedure media where I learn to use coding &  desgin to create immersive experiences such as installation art, games and animation. During that semester, I used a depth sensor to visualize the amount of carbon footprint of an individual. This project sparked my interest in information design as well as interactive media to solve real life issues.

The first project is a NGO startup that I founded called Frontida Records. We discovered that lots of low resources clinics in the world are all using inefficient paper record system. After conducting more than 100 user interviews with health providers in rural clinics, we decided to build electronic heatlh records that are easy-to-use, efficient and lightweight. I worked as a product manager to design an electronic heath record system working with 10 engineers to build a product that decreases 50% of documentation time with increased clinical diagnosis outcome. 
This past October, I was able to travel to one of the clinic we served in Panama to test our product in person. Seeing our product being used in real life was one of the proudest moments of my life. 

The second product I built in relation to healthcare was a consumer app that improve the grocery shopping experience during COVID-19. I worked as a full-stack engineer to build an mobile app that minimize your risk of covid-19 exposure based on your location and travel preferences. Our product won the 2020 hack for hope hackathon among 60+ teams from usc& ucla.

Besides building experience in the healthcarespace, I’ve also learned to use data-driven method to assess product performance, and discover product opportunities during my internship with Microsoft over the summer as PM. I used data-driven analytics to produce report on 10+ AI features in areas such as search, assistance as well as intelligence, and provided growth solutions impacting more than 100m users. I also worked with designers and machine learning engineers on the frontier of building accessibility features on Outlook. I learned to effectively communicate product requirements as well as managing stakeholders. 


On campus, I work as a teaching assistant for usc’s user experience design class. I teach design thinking and figma to aid more than 40 students to deliver MVP and wireframes. One project that i mentored this semester was actually an XR fitness product. 

What I enjoy the most from all my past experience in relation to product is being able to constantly learn about new technologies and turning the technology into an experience that are both enjoyable and useful. I would love to bring my experience to Cosm to work on exciting projects with you guys!
